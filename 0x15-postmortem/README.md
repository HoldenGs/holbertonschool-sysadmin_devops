Warp Speed Technologies Infrastructure Outage Report

On July 5th, 2026, Warp Speed Technologies’ engine test logging infrastructure experienced an outage during test #1046. The following report is a postmortem report of the outage.


Summary:

On July 5th 13:29 UTC to 13:47 UTC the log servers detected a drop in logging flow for heat-vector monitoring (HVM) instruments and tachyonic-coupler monitoring (TCM) instruments. This resulted in the emergency shutdown of testing for #1046. The shutdown commenced as a precaution to assess the risk of real-time monitoring errors, though no risk was found. The outage caused a loss of all data logging for the duration. The root cause was found to be the use of a deprecated text-encoding for all log files which only caused an error on the measuring units used for HVM and TCM.


Timeline:

13:29 UTC: Logging server begins collecting data on #1046, monitoring detects anomaly in HVM and TCM log files.

13:30 UTC - Engineers notified via automated text message.

13:32 UTC - Emergency shutdown of test #1046.

13:33 UTC - Testing Engineer lead notified and steps in.

13:37 UTC - Found no errors traced through from instruments until logging.

13:40 UTC - Unsuccessfully restart new configuration.

13:45 UTC - Rollback to old configuration.

13:47 UTC - Logging server up and running normally.

14:22 UTC - Root cause found.



Root Cause:

Before starting the logging server, a new logging server configuration which had gone through testing was pushed up to the production servers. This configuration passed testing because the testing did not incorporate up-to-date instances of the data being logged.




Resolution:

As the team restarted the servers with the old configuration, the bug was investigated by test engineer lead Kelley Harrison and the bug was soon identified. The test suite was found to have out-of-date data formats. Finding and fixing this issue allowed the Logging engineers to quickly identify the root cause of the logging outage. Once the test environments were updated, the new configuration was also patched, tested, and pushed.


Corrective and Preventative Measures:

After a review, we’ve compiled a list of tasks that can be done to prevent such a failure in the future.

Standardize data format across data-pipeline.
Automatically update logging-testing environment as updates to data-pipeline are made.
Manual review of logging-testing environment on a weekly basis.
Set up failover logging server in the event of a new configuration failure.


Warp Speed Technologies is committed to the most robust in data-analyzation technology as well as the safety of our engineers. We thank the engineers for their quick work and apologize to our shareholders for the drop in stock price.

Sincerely,
The Warp Speed Test Team
